        "question": "How does machine learning differ from traditional programming?",
        "options": [
          "Machine learning requires more code",
          "Machine learning allows systems to learn from data rather than being explicitly programmed",
          "Machine learning is slower",

        "answer": "Machine learning allows systems to learn from data rather than being explicitly programmed",
        "difficulty": "medium",
        "explanation": "The fundamental difference is that ML systems improve from experience and data, while traditional programming requires explicit instructions for every scenario."
